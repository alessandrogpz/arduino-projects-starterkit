This is a "warp speed" interface simulator.
The program's first run flashes the yellow lights as it were initializing the warp engine.
After a few blinks, it lights the green light, meaning that the warp engine is ready to go.
Both red lights light up and blink when the button is pressed, meaning that the warp engine is being used.
After using the warp engine, the status goes back to "ready to use", with the green light turned on.
