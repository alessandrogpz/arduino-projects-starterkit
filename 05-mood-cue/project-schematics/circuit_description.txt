The servo motor can turn 180 degrees.
From the 5v power we connect in parallel a 100um capacitor and a potentiometer. 
The potentiometer 3 pin (middle) sends information regarding its current resistence to A0 Analog In
Thius circuit connects to GND

in paralel with this circuit above, we connect (to the same ground and 5v power) another 100um capacitor and a servo motor
The middle pin of the Servo motor goes to Digital Pin 9, to be controled (via software) by the resistence in A0.
This circuit connects to GND

When we move the potentiometer, the Servo Motor also turns.
